# Scalable-Real-time-Data-Pipeline
*__DataSurge__* is a Spring Boot application for a real-time distributed data pipeline. 

The system design document clearly specifies the flow and purpose of this project.

**Note-** Currently based on Java, but I am considering porting to Python due to its versatility and more features in visualizing and dynamic configuration. The repository is currently private and will be made public as soon as the migration completes.

Technology Stack:
- Java (Spring Boot)
- Apache Kafka
- Docker
- Kubernetes

This project is still in progress. Check back later for more updates...
